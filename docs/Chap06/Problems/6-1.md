**a.** Consider the following counterexample.

- Input array $A = \langle 1, 2, 3 \rangle$:
- $\text{BUILD-MAX-HEAP}(A)$: $A = \langle 3, 2, 1 \rangle$.
- $\text{BUILD-MAX-HEAP}'(A)$: $A = \langle 3, 1, 2 \rangle$.

**b.** It is very easy to find out that the $\text{MAX-HEAP-INSERT}$ operation for each iteration takes $\Theta(\log i)$ time,  therefore the total time complexity is the sum of the individual complexities for $i$ from $2$ to $n$, which is : $\Theta(\log 2)+\Theta(\log 3)+\dots+\Theta(\log n)=\Theta(\log n!) $. By using Stirling's approximation, $\Theta (\log n!) \approx \Theta(n \log n)$, so the overall complexity is $\Theta(n\log‚Å° n)$.
